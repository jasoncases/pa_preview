## This is a truncated, preview version of the application</h2>
_code specific to our application can be found in the following directorys:_ 
- /src/Proaction
- /routes/subroutes
- /resources/views
- /public/js

<p>The php code is structured in "Domains", or related areas of concern, for anything that is not designated "System". "System" code is anything that relates to the specific mechanics of the application, i.e., login/logout, extending base Laravel classes, helper classes, etc.</p>

<p>The TypeScript modules are structures similarly, in tightly related domains and a "System" folder that is a collection of components and abstract classes</p>

<p>Due to the size and scope of the application, we elected to preview just a few of the current "Domains", however, it should be enough to give a good sense of the code you could be dealing with.</p>
